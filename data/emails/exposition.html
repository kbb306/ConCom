<p>Welcome Valued Employee!&trade;</p>
<p>If you are seeing this message, it means you have been granted clearance to oversee the company-wide restructuring initiative we call 'Operation Scrub' (Operation Cleanup was taken).</p>
<p>ConCom has had it's fingers in a lot of pies over the years, and a good number of those pies have now gone rotten. Due to the unwanted attention currently focused on the higher-ups, we here at 'Human Resources' have decided to give our company a fresh start. That means cleaning out all the baggage while also making enough money to build back better, and that means we need you!</p>
<span class='craigmail-large'><strong>Your Responsibilties:</strong></span>
<p> <h3>1. Oversee archive purge</h3>
    <p>The red progress bar at the bottom of your administrator panel tracks the various archives, servers and subdomains we are...cleaning up</p>
    <p>Usually the automated system can delete anything it finds by itself, but in the rare event it needs a human touch, you can manually delete the file from the 'terminal' tab. You will also be expected to penetration test possible hidden archive urls and add these to the deletion script.</p>
</p>
<p> <h3>2. Conduct all internal business through unlisted 'Craig Ferson' account</h3>
    <p> You didn't think we kept the account of our founder for history's sake, did you?</p>
    <p> Emails pertinent to your assignment will be sent to this account. You are to carry out these orders and delete all emails when finished. <span><strong>DO NOT REPLY TO OR SEND MESSAGES FROM THE ACCOUNT.</strong></span></p>
</p>
<p> <h3>3. Build FUNCTIONAL web hosting business to sustain ConCom during restructuring.</h3>
    <p> This new identity is NOT a front. We are, for all intents and purposes, actually divesting ourselves from all previous business ventures and leaving previous employees to their own, now unofficial, business. Whether that business is beneficial to or aligned with us in some way, that is no longer of interest to us or to the law. We are now (and officially, always have been) a good old fashioned web hosting service.</p>
        <p>This means your job is to help us become the BEST web hosting service. The new concomcompany.com site is yours to design, edit, upgrade, and protect. Try not to break it.</p>
</p>
<p> <h3>4. Sift through incoming data for items of value or interest.</h3>
    <p> While privacy is ConCom's core value, content moderation is still required by both company policy and Federal law. All traffic hosted or routed by our servers is temporarily saved onto the administrator partition. Locate anything "noteworthy" and flag it to prevent automatic deletion. Other players have a large head start in the data mines, so we're counting on you to pull a (sometimes) metaphorical double shift.</p>
</p>
<p> <h3>5. Monitor covert distributed computing network</h3>
    <p> Our terms of service clearly state in legally acceptable 2 point font that any and all spare processing and disk space on connected third party servers may be used to supplement our official hardware. Think of it like SETI@home, except we are looking for hidden intelligence in <em>cyberspace.</em> It's your job to ensure this network of unofficially leased computation remains functional and undetected.</p>
</p>

<p>You can expect to be part of this project for around 2-4 months, until another suitable employee is found and you are transferred out of office for security reasons. All emails that will not be needed by your successor should be deleted before leaving. Good luck!</p>
