    <p><span>Our story begins in 1986, when traveling 
        salvage salesman Craig Ferson happened upon the find of a lifetime: 15 derelict computers from an abandoned private research facility in Kentucky.&nbsp; Though 
        he had no experience with the digital world, Craig hit his local library and managed to cobble together a file hosting service. 
        His lifetime philosophy was "no questions asked," and he incorporated that into the core of his new company. 
        Finally, he called in a favor from the proprietor of a failed energy drink MLM, and got the catchy name that every product needs.</span></p>
    <br>

    <p><span>Ferson's "No Questions Asked" policy is still the foundation of our organization. At ConCom, we give you total control, customization and privacy in your digital domain, all at a price that old Craig would probably call "a killer deal."</span></p>
